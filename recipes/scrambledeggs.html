        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Whisk eggs with salt until completely
            combined and very foamy.</li> 
           <li>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat
             until bubbling. Add whisked eggs; cook,
              stirring frequently for even, moist curds,
               until thickened and creamy, but still
                shiny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
           <li>Remove scrambled eggs from the pan before
             they begin to look dry, as they will
              continue to thicken off the heat.</li>
        </ol>
